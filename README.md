This repository comprises of works compiled by Sahil Habibi, a current Quantitative Economics and Political Science student 
at the University of California, Irvine. 

I have a strong passion for economic research, and this repository will consist of different code that is made for
different economic research and analysis modalities. I am currently conducting my honors thesis on the economics and cause
of the rise of ticket prices at concerts for smaller artists. I am analyzing the impact of Live Nation's control over
amphitheater venues, as well as the effect of streaming and the effect of superstar artists on ticket prices. 

However, there will be more code in this repository, and they will range from:

- Honors Thesis Code
- Housing Policy Code
- Data Scraping
- Macroeconomic modeling in Python for RBC & New-Keynesian Models
and more.

My interests in research have a large range, from industrial organization to macroeconomics, health economics, labor economics, political economy, and much more.
I have a strong passion for economic research in many different fields, and thus there will be code posted that relates to different fields of
economic analysis posted to this repository.

The code will employ different languages for different purposes. These languages will use Stata, Python, R, and Matlab.
For example, there will be code added showing data scraping in Python, which is a more efficient language for data scraping compared to Stata. 
This will show different usages of different languages for different purposes, often for optimality purposes.

I am currently applying for Research Assistant positions, to gain experience in research and continue learning as I plan to pursue my PhD 
in Economics after finishing up my time as a research assistant.

Thus, this will be a place for any applicant reviewers to find code that showcases my coding experience and range.

This repository will continue to be updated as time goes on, with more code being added. Thus, checking the repository 
to see if more code has been added will be essential.
