This project showcases the difference between the RBC model with a fixed capital utilization, as compared to one with a variable capital utilization rate.

This model is an interesting comparison, as it allows households to further strain their capital in times of a shock to total factor productivity.

The goal of this project is to analyze the differences in impulse responses for labor, output, investment, and capital in response to a shock to total factor 
productivity between the model that assumes a constant utilization of capital, compared to the model that allows more freedom for capital to be utilized more heavily.

Notably, as our TFP is shocked, we see that the Marginal Product of Capital and Labor will rise, and so there will be a higher interest in utilizing capital and 
labor in the economy. However, because we've introduced our variable u raised the power gamma, this will allow for a possible further increase in the marginal 
product of capital and labor as a result of the TFP shock.

However, it's not entirely clear as to what the households will do, as this is not simply a complete win. Note that the byproduct of this increased strain on 
capital is the loss of capital, as you must replace it sooner due to the increase in wear and tear that is being placed. A factory will have to replace the equipment 
sooner because of the increased strain, and thus it will be a trade-off for the household that needs to be taken into account.

This is the purpose of this project, to utilize this trade-off to determine how the impulse responses will change immediately in response to a shock to TFP, 
as well as over time and how they may converge differently for the two models.
