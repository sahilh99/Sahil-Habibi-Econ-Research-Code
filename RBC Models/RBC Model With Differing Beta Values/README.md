This folder will house the results from an experiment conducted utilizing the Real Business Cycle 
model to analyze the differing impulse responses to labor, output, and consumption in response to 
a shock to total factor productivity (TFP) when changing the value for the consumption discount
factor beta.

Beta is the parameter utilized in the model to measure the relative desire of a household to 
consume in the present versus the future. A higher value for beta indicates an increased desire
to consume in the future compared to the present.

How does this value changing impact the impulse responses? Will labor be higher for the higher propensity
for future consumption group? Check the experiment to find out!
