This folder will serve as a folder that contains all of the different codes utilized for varying RBC models.

The Real Business Cycle model is one of the main macroeconomic models utilized to analyze the economy, which focuses 
specifically on the idea that the fluctuations seen during the business cycle are caused by changes to the total factor 
productivity, which is the solow growth residual, it's the leftover piece of the output in the cobb douglas production function. 
This posits that changes in technology, institutions, etc are the cause of these fluctuations.

This can be seen as the piece "A" in the Cobb douglas production function, all of the output that is not from capital or labor.

This model differs from the New-Keynesian model, which posits that it's not actually changes in TFP that cause these fluctuations, 
but rather shocks to demand, supply, and monetary policy. We will also explore the different versions of the New-Keynesian model with 
different parameter values and different shocks in this repository.

There are varying types of models that can be utilized from the RBC model, such as one that allows for variance of capital utilization, 
among other things. Thus, this folder will serve as a directory for different versions of the RBC model, while other models will be found in different folders.
