This folder has been created to house the experiment of conducting the Real Business Cycle model
with differing values of the coefficient on the prior term's TFP value, rho. 

The Real Business Cycle model posits that the main driver of the change in macroeconomic fluctuations 
is due to total factor productivity, which is the solow growth residual. It is called this because
it is the leftover piece of output in the Cobb-Douglas production function after dividing by capital
and labor.

How do impulse responses to output, labor, and consumption change when TFP is shocked by 1%, if we stipulate
that the TFP boost will last longer? Will labor still spike as high as it would if TFP didn't last as long?

The purpose of this experiment is to find out.
