This folder will serve to house code utilized for my honors thesis. I am currently conducting my Honors Thesis on analyzing 
the reasons for an over 110% price increase in the real high ticket price for concerts at amphitheater venues. I am examining:

(1) Switch to music consumption to streaming causing a potential rise in live music costs as the relation between digital music sales and live music revenues has severed
(2) Streaming causing an upward pressure on demand for live music, thus pushing the cost of attending live music upwards
(3) Superstar effects increasing over time, as it may be the case that superstar artists are becoming a larger and larger share of the artists, thus putting high demand on ticket prices
(4) Increased venue control by Live Nation over amphitheater venues, allowing them to act as monopolists in the concert booking and venue operation markets, leading to an upward pressure on prices

Our dataset is unique in that it has a unique focus on smaller artists, due to the fact we are restricted to only amphitheater venues. Typically live music analysis in the economic literature
is almost entirely restricted to the top artists, typically analyzing Top 100 tours or Top 200 tours. Thus, our dataset gives us a fascinating look at the economics of high, mid, and low level
artists. As an example, we only have one reading from Taylor Swift as a solo headliner, which was in 2009, before she was the superstar she is now. The same goes for Kendrick Lamar, except
he has four readings that all take place in 2013 or prior. Thus, our dataset comprises of a lot of smaller artists, or artists who are mid or high level, but not at the top.

There may be various codes added, ranging from data management, visualization, and regressoin code to data scraping and other things involved.
