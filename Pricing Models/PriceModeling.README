This folder is dedicated to code that is utilized to analyze different pricing methods. Markets, industrial organization,
and anti-trust are all strong interests of mine. Thus, there will often be different projects, papers, or others that
are made to analyze how markets may function, or how pricing strategies have changed over time. 

This may be looking at concert ticket prices per my Honors Thesis, sports, or airline ticket pricing.
