This folder houses materials associated to an analysis of rules pertaining to bank underwriting 
and banker guarantees. The analysis centers around the possibility that there was an unspoken
rule that the underwriter of a security would need to put up a guarantee to be on the hook
for a portion of the security itself in the case that the price was too high and the bank
was unable to flip the security for a profit. When the bank underwrites securities, it's looking
to flip for a profit, not hold. Thus, this acts as a hedge against the risk the bank is exposed to
by pushing it off onto the bank underwriter.
