This folder will house code for experimenting with New-Keynesian macro-economic models. The New-Keynesian model differs from the 
Real Business Cycle model in that it posits that the main driver of fluctuation in macroeconomic quantities over the business cycle
is not the solow residual "A", also known as total factor productivity, but rather it is due to shocks to aggregate demand, supply, and
monetary policy.

Thus, this folder will house different iterations of the New-Keynesian model, analyzing the different predictions and impulse responses
expected from the model due to shocks, and differing parameter values.
